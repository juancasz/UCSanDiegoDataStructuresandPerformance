# UCSanDiego Data Structures and Performance
Coursera description: In this course, you will use and analyze data structures that are used in industry-level applications, such as linked lists, trees, and hashtables.  You will explain how these data structures make programs more efficient and flexible.  You will apply asymptotic Big-O analysis to describe the performance of algorithms and evaluate which strategy to use for efficient data retrieval, addition of new data, deletion of elements, and/or memory usage.

The teachers of this course already provides a GUI to work with. The students have to build the backend for this project. The idea is to process the text that the user typed and then activate functions like spelling suggestions and auto complete. All of this is accomplished using data structures like linked lists, hash maps, trees and basic search algorithms.
